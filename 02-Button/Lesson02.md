# Lesson 02 - Button

In this lesson we will expand upon our knowledge controlling device through 
output by including a physical input to control the state of an LED. 
Specifically we will use a tact or momentary switch to control when an LED turns
on and off.

## Setup

### What you need:

* Raspberry Pi (any model)
* Any color LED
* Momentary button
* 10K ohm resistor
* 220 ohm resistor
* Jumper Cables (female to male if not using a pi cobbler)
* Bread Board
* (Optional) [Pi Cobbler](https://goo.gl/LhVmEg)

### Setting up your Environment

See [setup in Lesson 01](../01-Blink/Lesson01.md#setting-up-your-environment).
